# dot-files
This repository contains my standard configuration.  Hopefully you find it useful.  These are cobbled together from many other interesting places.

### Files

+ vim-init - Configuration file made for neovim
+ bashrc - Bash shell configuration, may need to be split into ***.bashrc*** and ***.bash_aliases***

### Installation
Run make `$make install`, because make is solid.  Or do it manually.  `$head <file>` if you don't know where it belongs.
