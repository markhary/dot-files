# dot-files
This repository contains my standard configuration.  Hopefully you find it useful.  These are cobbled together from many other interesting places.

### Files

+ aliases - Useful aliases (bash and zsh support)
+ bash_profile - Bash shell configuration
+ vim-init - Configuration file made for neovim
+ zshrc - Configuration file for zsh

### Installation
Run make `$make install`, because make is solid.  Or do it manually.  `$head <file>` if you don't know where it belongs.

You'll have to copy bash_profile manually.
``` cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile```
